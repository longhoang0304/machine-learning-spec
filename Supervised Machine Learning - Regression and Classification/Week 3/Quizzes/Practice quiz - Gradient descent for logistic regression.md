**1. Which of the following two statements is a more accurate statement about gradient descent for logistic regression?**
- [x] The update steps look like the update steps for linear regression, but the definition of $f_{\vec{w},b}(x^{(i)})$ is different.
- [ ] The update steps are identical to the update steps for linear regression.

Note: For logistic regression, $f_{\vec{w},b}(x^{(i)})$ is the sigmoid function instead of a straight line.
