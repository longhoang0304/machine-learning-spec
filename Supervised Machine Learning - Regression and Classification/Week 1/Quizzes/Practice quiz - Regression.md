**1. For linear regression, the model is $f_{w,b}(x)=wx + b$ Which of the following are the inputs, or features, that are fed into the model and with which the model is expected to make a prediction?**
  - [ ] $(x,y)$
  - [ ] m
  - [x] x
  - [ ] $w$ and $b$

**2. For linear regression, if you find parameters $w$ and $b$ so that $J(w,b)$ is very close to zero, what can you conclude?**
  - [ ] The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really poorly.
  - [ ] This is never possible -- there must be a bug in the code. 
  - [x] The selected values of the parameters ww and bb cause the algorithm to fit the training set really well.
