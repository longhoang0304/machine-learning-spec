- Answer: 30
Note: Yes! $x^{(3)}_4$ is the 4th feature (4th column in the table) of the 3rd training example (3rd row in the table)

**2. Which of the following are potential benefits of vectorization? Please choose the best option.**
  - [ ] It makes your code run faster
  - [ ] It can make your code shorter 
  - [ ] It allows your code to run more easily on parallel compute hardware
  - [x] All of above

**3. True/False? To make gradient descent converge about twice as fast, a technique that almost always works is to double the learning rate $alpha$** 
  - [x] False
  - [ ] True
