**1. If the model's cross validation error JcvJcv​ is much higher than the training error JtrainJtrain​, this is an indication that the model has…**

- [ ] Low bias
- [x] high variance
- [ ] high bias
- [ ] Low variance

Note: When $J_{cv} >> J_{train}$​, whether $J_{train}$ is also high or not, this is a sign that the model is overfitting to the training data and performing much worse on new examples.

**2. Which of these is the best way to determine whether your model has high bias (has underfit the training data)?**

![](./Imgs/C2W3Q2_Img2.png)

- [x] Compare the training error to the baseline level of performance
- [ ] Compare the training error to the cross validation error.
- [ ] See if the cross validation error is high compared to the baseline level of performance 
- [ ] See if the training error is high (above 15% or so) 

Note: Correct. If comparing your model's training error to a baseline level of performance (such as human level performance, or performance of other well-established models), if your model's training error is much higher, then this is a sign that the model has high bias (has underfit).

**3. You find that your algorithm has high bias. Which of these seem like good options for improving the algorithm’s performance? Hint: two of these are correct.**

- [ ] Remove examples from the training set
- [ ] Collect more training examples 
- [x] Decrease the regularization parameter λλ (lambda)
  - Note: Correct. Decreasing regularization can help the model better fit the training data.
- [x] Collect additional features or add polynomial features 
  - Note: Correct. More features could potentially help the model better fit the training examples.

**4. You find that your algorithm has a training error of 2%, and a cross validation error of 20% (much higher than the training error). Based on the conclusion you would draw about whether the algorithm has a high bias or high variance problem, which of these seem like good options for improving the algorithm’s performance? Hint: two of these are correct.**

- [ ] Decrease the regularization parameter λλ
- [x] Increase the regularization parameter λλ
  - Yes, the model appears to have high variance (overfit), and increasing regularization would help reduce high variance.
- [ ] Reduce the training set size 
- [x] Collect more training data
  - Note: Yes, the model appears to have high variance (overfit), and collecting more training examples would help reduce high variance.
