**1. According to the lecture, how do you calculate the activation of the third neuron in the first layer using NumPy?**
![](./Imgs/C2W1A4-Img1.jpg)
- [ ] 
```python
layer_1 = Dense(units=3, activation='sigmoid')
a_1 = layer_1(x)
```

- [ ] 
```python
z1_3 =w1_3 * x + b
a1_3 = sigmoid(z1_3)
```

- [x]  
```python
z1_3 = np.dot(w1_3, x) + b1_3
a1_3 = sigmoid(z1_3)
```

**2. According to the lecture, when coding up the numpy array W, where would you place the w parameters for each neuron?**

- [X] In the columns of W.
- [ ] In the rows of W.

**3. For the code above in the "dense" function that defines a single layer of neurons, how many times does the code go through the "for loop"? Note that W has 2 rows and 3 columns.**

- [ ] 2 times
- [X] 3 times
- [ ] 5 times 
- [ ] 6 times
